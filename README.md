# ybot2xdbot
Python scripts that can convert text-converted yBot macros to popular macros.
Currently only supports .xd files for xdBot.

## This requires the yBot macros to be already converted, please check [this file from yBot server](https://discord.com/channels/717848229068275853/1170355023100780555/1213884640289628160) as it can only do so after the macro is converted to plain text.
